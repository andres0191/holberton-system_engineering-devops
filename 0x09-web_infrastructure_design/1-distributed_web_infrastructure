With what distribution algorithm your load balancer is configured and how it works
Round Robin Algorithm: The server supports requests sequentially. after sending the
request to the last server, start again from the first server. This algorithm is used.
when the servers have the same specifications and there are not many connections
persistent

Does your load balancer allow an Active-Active or Active-Passive configuration, explain the difference between the two
An active / passive configuration will offer you many advantages, so consider buying a pair of balancers
load and configure them in H / A mode. When this is done, the main load balancer distributes the traffic of
network to the most appropriate server, while the second load balancer works in listening mode to monitor
constantly the performance of the primary load balancer and is ready at any time to intervene and
take charge of load balancing tasks in case the main load balancer fails.

How a main replication database cluster (master-slave) works
The process of replicating a database consists of replicating update queries (both DML and DDL)
in a master database (master) on one or several slave databases, so that we have a copy
of them over time.

MySQL supports asynchronous unidirectional replication, that is, the update queries executed in the master are
replicated on slave servers. This replication is done transparently. It is also instantaneous if the
Slave servers are up and in replication state. Data modifications must always be made
In the master, if you want to be able to modify the data in any database you will have to go to other solutions such as MySQL Cluster.
