#Time to practice configuring your server with Puppet! Just as 
#you did before, weâ€™d like you to install and configure an Nginx
#server using Puppet instead of Bash. To save time and effort, you
#should also include resources in your manifest to perform a 301
#redirect when querying /redirect_me.
