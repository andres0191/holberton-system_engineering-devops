DevOps is a set of practices that combines software development (Dev) and IT operations (Ops). It aims to shorten the systems development life cycle and provide continuous delivery with high software quality. DevOps is complementary with Agile software development; several DevOps aspects came from Agile methodology. 

## Defined DevOps model

Development operations are a combination of cultural philosophies, practices, and tools that increase an organization's ability to deliver applications and services at high speed: develop and improve products faster than organizations using traditional management and software development processes of infrastructure. This speed enables organizations to better serve their customers and compete more effectively in the marketplace.

Under a DevOps model, development and operations teams are no longer "isolated." Sometimes the two teams merge into one, where engineers work across the entire application lifecycle, from development and testing to deployment and operations, and develop a variety of skills not limited to a single function.

In some DevOps models, QA and security teams are also more integrated with development and operations, and are involved throughout the application life cycle. When security is the priority of all DevOps members, it is sometimes referred to as development security operations.

Teams use practices to automate processes that have previously been manual and time consuming. They use a stack of technology and tools that help them operate and improve applications quickly and reliably. Additionally, these tools help engineers independently perform tasks that would normally have required the assistance of other teams (for example, implement code or provision infrastructure), further increasing team speed.
