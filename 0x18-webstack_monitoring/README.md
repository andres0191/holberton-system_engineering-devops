# What is Server Monitoring?
Server Monitoring is the process of monitoring all the system resources associated with the server in order to understand their resource usage patterns and optimize them accordingly to provide a better end-user experience. It ensures that your server is capable of hosting your applications by providing sufficient data relating to the performance of your system and helps you understand the system operations.

While most server monitoring tools provide real time server monitoring and generate notifications in case of performance issues, a perceptive tool like Applications Manager will also provide comprehensive insight into the root cause of the issues and helps you troubleshoot them quickly.


## Monitor key metrics in real-time
Metrics such as CPU utilization & Disk Utilization are critical attributes to keep an eye on to extrapolate the load on your CPU and assess the overall server memory utilization. You can understand the amount of load on the server by tracking parameters such as traffic, utilization and number of packets sent/received in the network interface.

Applications Manager's server performance monitoring provides thorough real time server monitoring for various important metrics such as:

Memory Utilization
Disk I/O
Network Interface and Adapters
Hardware Health
Scheduled Tasks
Syslog Errors
Event Logs, etc.
